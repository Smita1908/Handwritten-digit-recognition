# 🖋️ Handwritten-digit-recognition
- 💡Goal: Handwritten digit recognition using a Logistic Regression Model 
- 📊 Dataset: MNIST - an inbuilt torchvision Image Classification Dataset
- 📚Labels: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
  
- # ⚙️🧩 First Model Architecture: 
  - Logistic Regression model containing one fully connected linear layer 
  - Input: Each training example is a vector, each `1x28x28` image tensor is flattened into a vector of size `784 (28*28)` before being passed into the model
  - Output:
    - The output for each image is a vector of size 10, with each element signifying the probability of a particular target label (i.e., 0 to 9).
    - The predicted label for an image is simply the one with the highest probability. The softmax function is used.
-🪜📈 Training and evaluation
    - Optimizer : Stochastic Gradient Descent
    - Loss Function: Cross Entropy
    - Accuracy: Computed as percentage of correct predictions
  -📤 Results and conclusions:
     - Test accuracy: At the end of 20 epochs is approximately **83%**
     - Validation accuracy: Improved with each epoch
    -📜🚩Conclusion: Linear model does not take into consideration the non linear relationship which can be there in the data
       
 - # ⚙️🧩 Second Model Architecture:
   - Fully connected Neural Network with following layers:
        - An Input layer
        - A  hidden layer
        - An output layer. 
    - Input: Each training example is a vector, each `1x28x28` image tensor is flattened into a vector of size `784 (28*28)` before being passed into the model
    - Output:
      - The output for each image is a vector of size 10, with each element signifying the probability of a particular target label (i.e., 0 to 9).
      - The predicted label for an image is simply the one with the highest probability.

    - Optimizer : Gradient Descent
    - Loss Function: Cross Entropy
    - Accuracy: Computed as percentage of correct predictions
  - 📤Results and conclusions:
    - Test accuracy: At the end of 10 epochs is approximately **92%**
    - Validation accuracy: Improved with each epoch
    - 📜✅Conclusion: FFNN model does not improve beyond **92%**, we can add more hidden layers to learn more complex representation of the images, adding activation functions
